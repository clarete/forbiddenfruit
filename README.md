# Forbidden Fruit

![Forbidden Fruit](logo.png)

This project allows Python code to extend built-in types.

If that's a good idea or not, you tell me. The first need this project
attended was allowing a [Python assertion
library](https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/sure) to implement a similar
API to [RSpec
Expectations](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations) and
[should.js](https://shouldjs.github.io/). But people got creative and
used it to among other things [spy on
things](https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt/blob/43a64ac1a030be79741402d8920a6da253a96670/src/flynt/file_spy.py)
or to [integrate
profiling](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/e38eae0d1fe442924f4256d4bc87710a4cb6f142/localstack/utils/analytics/profiler.py).

## Tiny Example

It basically allows you to patch built-in objects, declared in C
through python. Just like this:

1. Add a new method to the `int` class:
```python
>>> from forbiddenfruit import curse
>>> def words_of_wisdom(self):
...     return self * "blah "
>>> curse(int, "words_of_wisdom", words_of_wisdom)
>>> assert (2).words_of_wisdom() == "blah blah "
```
2. Add a `classmethod` to a built-in class
```python
>>> from forbiddenfruit import curse
>>> def hello(self):
...     return "blah"
>>> curse(str, "hello", classmethod(hello))
>>> assert str.hello() == "blah"
```

### Reversing a curse

If you want to free your object from a curse, you can use the `reverse()`
function. Just like this:

```python
>>> from forbiddenfruit import curse, reverse
>>> curse(str, "test", "blah")
>>> assert 'test' in dir(str)
>>> # Time to reverse the curse
>>> reverse(str, "test")
>>> assert 'test' not in dir(str)
```

## Compatibility

Forbbiden Fruit is tested on CPython 2.7, 3.0, and 3.3-3.7.

Since Forbidden Fruit is fundamentally dependent on the C API,
this library won't work on other python implementations, such
as Jython, pypy, etc.
